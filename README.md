# Back-To-Basics
Starting from Scratch in Data Science &amp; ML 

*I. Foundational Concepts*
Supervised, Unsupervised, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning: These are the fundamental paradigms of machine learning. Start here to categorize all other algorithms and concepts.
Overfitting, Underfitting, Variance, Bias: These concepts are critical to understanding how models learn and why they sometimes perform poorly.The Bias-Variance Tradeoff is a central theme in machine learning.
Error Types: Understanding Type I (False Positive) and Type II (False Negative) errors is crucial for evaluating model performance, especially in classification.

*II. The Data Pipeline*
This section covers the practical steps of preparing data before modeling.
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): This is the first step of any data science project. It involves summarizing the data's main characteristics, often with visualizations.
Feature Engineering: The process of using domain knowledge to create new features from raw data to improve model performance. This is often the most impactful step in a project.
Feature Scaling: Techniques like Standardization and Normalization are used to scale numerical features to a standard range, which is essential for many algorithms.
Vectorization: Converting raw data (like text) into numerical vectors that a machine learning model can understand.

*III. Core Machine Learning Algorithms & Concepts*
Once the data is ready, you can delve into the models themselves.
Supervised Learning
Linear Regression: A foundational algorithm for regression tasks.
Polynomial Regression: An extension of linear regression that can model non-linear relationships.
Logistic Regression: The go-to algorithm for binary classification.
k-NN Algorithm (k-Nearest Neighbors): A simple and intuitive algorithm for both classification and regression based on proximity.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
SVM (Support Vector Machines): A powerful algorithm for classification and regression that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate data points.
Unsupervised Learning
Hierarchical Clustering: An algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters.
PCA (Principal Component Analysis): A technique for dimensionality reduction.
Ensemble Methods: These combine multiple models to produce a single, superior prediction.
Bagging (e.g., Random Forest): Builds multiple models independently and averages their predictions.
Boosting (e.g., XGBoost): Builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting the errors of the previous one.

*IV. Model Training & Optimization*
These concepts relate to how models are trained to find the best possible parameters.
Gradient Descent: The primary optimization algorithm used to train most machine learning and deep learning models. It's an iterative process of finding the local minimum of a function.
Regularization: Techniques like L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization are used to prevent overfitting by penalizing large model parameters.
Hypothesis Testing: A statistical method for making inferences about a population parameter. This is often used to validate the significance of a model's features or to compare different models.
Bootstrapping: A resampling method used to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic by repeatedly drawing samples with replacement from the original data.

*V. Deep Learning*
This section focuses on more advanced neural network architectures.
Neural Nets: The fundamental structure of deep learning, composed of layers of interconnected "neurons."
Activation Functions: Non-linear functions applied to the output of a neuron to introduce complexity.
Backpropagation: The algorithm used to efficiently calculate the gradients for a neural network, allowing it to learn from its errors.
Advanced Architectures:
CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): Specialized for image and spatial data.
RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks): Designed for sequential data like text or time series.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of RNN that can remember information over long periods.
Transformers: A more recent architecture that has become dominant in NLP.
Autoencoders: Used for dimensionality reduction and data compression.
GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks): Used for generating new data that resembles the training data.

*VI. Model Evaluation & Deployment*
Once a model is trained, it must be evaluated and made ready for use.
Performance Metrics: How you measure a model's success.
Classification Metrics:
Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions.
Precision: The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
Recall: The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified.
ROC Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic) and AUC (Area Under the Curve): Visual and numerical measures of a model's ability to distinguish between classes.
Model Pipeline Building: The process of creating a reusable, automated workflow for training and deploying models. This is where you combine all the previous steps.
